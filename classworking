Create a function that takes an array 
of integers as an argument and returns an array, 
where the first element is the count of positive numbers 
and the second element is sum of negative numbers.


function countPosumNev(input) {

const result = [];
let sum =0;
let count=0;


for (let i=0; i<input.length; i++){

if(input[i] <= 0)
{
sum = sum + input[i];
}

 else
{
 count += 1;

}

}console.log(count, sum);
}




//1)Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book
 and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), 
 and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).
2)Iterate through the array of books. For each book, 
log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".
Now use an if/else statement to change the output 
depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, 
log a string like 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', 
and if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'


const book1={
title:'the Hobbit',
auther:'J.R.R',
readed:false

};

const book2={
title:'Game of throuns',
auther:'A.D.N',
readed:true

};

let checkBooks=[];

for (i=0; i<checkBooks.length;i++){

    let name='';
    if (checkBooks[i].readed=true){

       console.log( "You already read "+""+checkBooks[i].title+""+"by"+""+ checkBooks[i].auther );
    }
    else {
console.log( "You still need to read "+""+checkBooks[i].title+""+"by"+""+ checkBooks[i].auther );
    }
}


//Create an object to store the following
 information about your favorite movie: 
 title (a string), duration (a number), and stars (an array of strings).
Print out the movie information 
like so: "Puff the Magic Dragon lasts for 30 minutes. 
Stars: Puff, Jackie, Living Sneezes."
Maybe the join method will be helpful here

const favMov={
title:'Game of throuns',
duration:2,
stars:["jhone","Arya","Sansa"]
};

function printMov(movie) {
    console.log(movie.title + ' lasts for ' + movie.duration + ' minutes');
    console.log('It stars ' + movie.stars.join(', '));
}
printMov(favMov);
